### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**Spriy4nshu/Spriy4nshu** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Smart Reader for almost everything.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning sentiment analysis in text and speech.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: HE/HIM
- âš¡ Fun fact: Sometimes it pays to stay in bed on Monday, rather than spending the rest of the week debugging Mondayâ€™s code.
